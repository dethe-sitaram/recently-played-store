Recently Played Store Test

This is a simple Java project that tests the RecentlyPlayedStore class, which is a class that keeps track of recently played songs for users. The code includes unit tests for the RecentlyPlayedStore class, which can be run from the command line using Maven.

# Prerequisites

Before running the tests, you'll need to make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Java JDK 1.8 or higher
Maven 3.6 or higher Running the tests

# To run the tests from the command line, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt
Navigate to the root directory of the project
Run the following command to compile the code and run the tests:

mvn test

This will compile the code, run the tests, and generate a report with the test results. You should see output in the console indicating whether the tests passed or failed.

If any tests fail, you'll see an error message with details about the failure. Otherwise, you should see a message indicating that all tests passed.
